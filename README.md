# The Rose Garden — Sev Graduation Website

A single-page interactive graduation gift website. Six sequential sections, path-based exploration with delayed gratification, pure CSS + vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks. Live: **https://k1ng0mar.github.io/sev-graduation/**

---

## 1. Mission

Build a custom interactive graduation website for Sev, a close friend, as a personal gift. Ship by June 19, 2026 (her graduation day). Subject profile extracted via casual Q&A game on June 18, 2026.

---

## 2. Sev — Subject Profile

Extracted preferences (from Q&A game, 2026-06-18):

| # | Question | Answer | Interpretation |
|---|----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | One flower for life | Roses | Classic, premium taste |
| 2 | Comfort song | "Don't Stop Till You Get Enough" (MJ) | Groove, unstoppable energy |
| 3 | Sunrise or sunset | Sunrise | Forward-looking, optimistic |
| 4 | Spirit animal | Jaguar | Power, stealth, independence |
| 5 | Associated word | "Feisty" | Self-aware, won't be managed |
| 6 | Sweet or savory | Both | Duality, doesn't reduce to binaries |
| 7 | Teleport destination | Monaco | Expensive taste, glamour |
| 8 | Favorite season | Autumn | Transitions, complexity |
| 9 | Favorite color | Pink | (stated directly) |
| 10 | Photos | None available | Must use SVG only |

**Aesthetic read:** Classic, premium. Bold but soft. Doesn't apologize. Expensive taste without trying too hard. Pink should feel like Monaco roses at dawn, not children's birthday.

## 3. Concept: "The Rose Garden"

A path-based interactive experience. The visitor enters a garden at sunrise and journeys through six sections. Each section unlocks only after a small interaction is completed. Each section weaves in one or more of Sev's preferences naturally, without feeling forced.

### Narrative arc

```
Dawn (sunrise, "For Sev")
  → user clicks "Enter the Garden"
Garden (plant 3 roses by clicking)
  → after 3 roses, reveal message, continue button appears
Jaguar (glowing eyes in shadow → click → silhouette reveal)
  → message, continue button
Monaco (memory match: 5 luxury pairs)
  → all matched, reveal message, continue button
Autumn (catch 6 falling leaves, each carries a wish)
  → all caught, reveal message, continue button
Reveal (graduation congratulations, petal confetti, disco groove)
  → "Play Celebration" button plays Web Audio API bassline
```

### Delayed gratification mechanics
- Sections only become visible when the previous section's interaction is complete
- Reveal messages fade in with `transition: opacity 1.5s ease, transform 1.5s ease`
- Continue buttons are `opacity: 0` until reveal triggers
- Progress tracker at top fills rose-petal dots as sections are completed
- Final reveal has a 1.5s delay before petal confetti starts

## 4. Design System

### Color palette (Monaco Roses at Dawn)
| Token | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| `--dawn-1` | #1a0a1a | Deepest pre-dawn |
| `--dawn-2` | #4a1942 | Pre-dawn purple |
| `--dawn-3` | #8b3a5e | Dawn purple-pink |
| `--dawn-4` | #d4748a | Pink horizon |
| `--dawn-5` | #f5c9a8 | Apricot gold |
| `--dawn-6` | #ffd9a0 | Dawn amber |
| `--rose` | #c44569 | Primary rose |
| `--rose-deep` | #9b2d4e | Deep rose accent |
| `--rose-gold` | #c9a96e | Rose gold accent |
| `--blush` | #fce4ec | Card backgrounds |
| `--pink-soft` | #fdf2f8 | Lightest background |
| `--amber` | #d4a574 | Autumn/gold |
| `--monaco-teal` | #5b9ea6 | Monaco water |
| `--ink` | #3a1c2a | Body text |
| `--white-warm` | #fff9f5 | Warm white |

### Typography
- **Display:** Playfair Display (Google Fonts) — serif headings
- **Body:** Cormorant Garamond (Google Fonts) — soft serif body
- **Script:** Dancing Script (Google Fonts) — handwritten accent ("For Sev", "With love, your friend")

### Motion principles
- M3 motion physics inspiration: spring-based easing via `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`
- 3-second rule for total animation time per section
- Parallax depth via background gradient stops
- Section transitions: `transition: opacity 1.2s ease, visibility 1.2s`

## 5. Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Single HTML file:** 37KB, no build step
- **CSS:** Inline `<style>`, ~400 lines, custom properties for theming
- **JavaScript:** Inline `<script>`, vanilla, ~400 lines
- **External dependencies:** Google Fonts only (no GSAP, no React, no jQuery)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via `k1ng0mar/sev-graduation` repo

### Sections
| # | ID | Type | Interaction | Reveal condition |
|---|----|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | `dawn` | Landing | Click "Enter the Garden" | Always visible |
| 2 | `garden` | Plant roses | Click 3 times to plant roses | 3 roses planted |
| 3 | `jaguar` | Click eyes | Click `.jaguar-eyes` element | Eyes clicked |
| 4 | `monaco` | Memory match | Flip 10 cards, match 5 pairs | 5 pairs matched |
| 5 | `autumn` | Catch leaves | Click 6 falling leaves | 6 leaves caught |
| 6 | `reveal` | Finale | Click "Play Celebration" | Always reachable |

### Inline SVG illustrations
- **Rose:** 9-element SVG (stem, 2 leaves, 3 petal layers, center, highlight) — randomly varied colors and rotation
- **Jaguar silhouette:** 1 path body + 2 eye ellipses + 8 spot circles
- **Monaco skyline:** 1 path with 30+ coordinate points (Monaco buildings silhouette)
- **Autumn leaf:** 3 paths (body, vein, side veins)
- **Graduation cap:** 3 paths (mortarboard, base, tassel)
- **Particles:** 20 floating dots on Dawn (CSS animation, no SVG)
- **Petal confetti:** 40 divs animated via requestAnimationFrame on Reveal

### Web Audio API
- **Audio chime helper** (`playChime`): sine oscillator, 0.12 gain envelope, exponential decay
  - Rose plant: 660Hz → 740Hz → 820Hz (ascending with each rose)
  - Card match: 523Hz + 50Hz per match
  - Leaf catch: 440Hz + 60Hz per leaf
- **Disco groove** (`playGroove`): 116 BPM, 8 bars
  - Sawtooth bass (filtered through 600Hz lowpass, Q=8)
  - Hi-hats on off-beats (white noise through 8kHz highpass)
  - Kick on beats 1 and 3 (150Hz → 40Hz pitch sweep)
  - Original composition, no copyrighted material

## 6. Multi-Agent Coordination

This project was orchestrated across multiple AI agents. Below is the complete roster, model identities, roles, and outcomes.

### Agents involved

| Agent | Model | Provider | Role | Status | Output |
|-------|-------|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **Nyx** (this agent) | GLM-5.2 (z-ai) via Nous Portal | Nous | Orchestrator, builder, deployer | ✅ Active | All code, design, deployment, documentation |
| **Ash** (Openclaw) | `openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` | OpenRouter via Openclaw | Content writer | ✅ Success | All website copy (welcome, section reveals, game items, leaf messages, final congratulations) |
| **MoA** (mixture_of_agents) | Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6 (aggregator) + Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5.4 Pro, Deepseek v3.2 (reference) | OpenRouter | Creative direction synthesis | ❌ Failed | OpenRouter credits exhausted (402 error) |
| **Opencode CLI** | `opencode/mimo-v2.5-free` | OpenCode (configured) | Code generation | ⚪ Not used | Orchestrator wrote code directly; faster than delegation |
| **Kilo Code CLI** | Kilo default | Kilo Code | Code review | ⚪ Not used | Pure CSS/vanilla JS; no framework review needed |
| **Deepseek V4 Pro** | `deepseek-v4-pro` | hyper.charm.land (custom endpoint) | Enhancement ideas | ✅ Success (after API key provided) | 5 enhancement ideas implemented: pollen burst, audio chimes, feisty easter egg, accessibility focus styles, sr-only announcer |

### Model details

**GLM-5.2 (z-ai) — Nyx (orchestrator)**
- Via Nous Portal
- Self-identification adjusted from prior `MiniMax-M3` model on switch
- Sole builder of the HTML/CSS/JS file, deployment, and documentation
- Used the built-in `mixture_of_agents` tool (which failed due to upstream credits)

**NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Ultra (550B-A55B, free tier) — Ash**
- OpenRouter model ID: `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free`
- Accessed via Openclaw `agent` command: `openclaw agent --agent main --json -m "..."`
- Default Openclaw identity (named "Ash" via IDENTITY.md)
- Generated all text content in a single invocation
- Output quality: high — produced elegant, personalized, non-cutesy copy
- Content saved to `/home/ubuntu/sev-graduation/content.md`

**MoA internal models**
- Reference models: `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`, `google/gemini-2.5-pro`, `openai/gpt-5.4-pro`, `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`
- Aggregator: `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`
- Failure: 402 Payment Required — OpenRouter account credits exhausted
- Error: `This request requires more credits, or fewer max_tokens. You requested up to 65536 tokens, but can only afford 815.`
- Fell back to orchestrator-direct creative direction

**Mimo v2.5 (free) — Opencode**
- OpenCode model ID: `opencode/mimo-v2.5-free`
- Not actually invoked for this project (orchestrator built directly)
- Verified available via `opencode models` command

**Kilo Code**
- Version 7.3.46
- Not actually invoked for this project
- Verified available via `which kilo`

**Deepseek V4 Pro**
- Custom endpoint: `https://hyper.charm.land/v1/chat/completions`
- API key: `sk-hyper-c5385a50-931a-4757-8763-278278a1a0d0` (provided by user on 2026-06-18)
- OpenAI-compatible chat completions API
- Used post-deployment to generate enhancement ideas
- 5 ideas returned; 4 implemented (pollen burst, audio chimes, feisty easter egg, accessibility)
- 1 idea skipped (IntersectionObserver section reveals — unnecessary since navigation is programmatic)

### Coordination protocol
- **Primary orchestrator:** Nyx (this session)
- **Coordination doc:** `~/obsidian-vault/projects/sev-graduation.md`
- **Communication channel:** Synchronous CLI invocations + file-based handoff
- **No autonomous loop:** All agent calls were direct, no recursive delegation

## 7. Content Sources

### From Ash (Openclaw / Nemotron-3-Ultra)
Saved to `/home/ubuntu/sev-graduation/content.md`. Full text:

**Dawn welcome:**
> The garden waits in first light. Step onto the path — something beautiful is blooming for you.

**Garden reveal:**
> You've always loved roses — the way they open slowly, unapologetically pink, thorns and all. Here, every rose you plant stays in bloom. This garden remembers what you give it.

**Jaguar reveal:**
> Golden eyes in the undergrowth. A jaguar doesn't announce itself — it simply is, fierce and quiet, moving through shadow like it owns the night. You know that energy. Feisty doesn't mean loud. It means unstoppable.

**Monaco reveal:**
> Sunlight on turquoise water. The clink of crystal, the scent of jasmine on warm wind — Monaco holds the kind of luxury that doesn't shout. It whispers, and you lean in to listen. Some memories are meant to be savored slowly.

**Autumn reveal:**
> Leaves falling like confetti in amber and rust. Autumn doesn't choose between sweet and savory — it gives you both, crisp apples and roasted chestnuts, endings and beginnings tangled together. This path holds a little of each.

**Final reveal:**
> Sev, you did it. Not because the path was easy, but because you refused to quit — feisty, focused, moving to your own rhythm like that MJ bassline that never stops driving forward. The garden you've planted is just beginning to show its colors, and every rose, every golden leaf, every quiet roar of that jaguar spirit is yours. Congratulations, graduate. The world better get ready — you're only getting started.

**Monaco memory match pairs:**
1. Cartier Watch → Timeless
2. Silk Scarf → Grace
3. Casino Chip → Fortune
4. Chateau Yquem → Golden
5. Driving Gloves → Control

**Autumn leaf messages (6):**
1. May your roots go deep and your branches reach fearless toward the light.
2. The sweetest victories are the ones you fought for.
3. Autumn teaches us that letting go can be breathtakingly beautiful.
4. Stay sharp, stay soft — the world needs both of you.
5. Every ending is a threshold. Step through.
6. You were made for more than surviving. You were made for blooming.

## 10. Enhancement History

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `9568075` | Initial commit — full 6-section site, no GSAP, pure CSS + vanilla JS |
| `427b7a2` | Deepseek enhancements: pollen burst on rose plant, audio chimes on every interaction, "feisty" easter egg (type "feisty" anywhere to trigger rose-gold petal burst), accessibility focus-visible outlines, sr-only announcer |

---

## 11. Known Limitations & Notes

- **Audio requires user gesture.** Web Audio API cannot autoplay on page load. User must click "Play Celebration" on the Reveal section to hear the disco groove. The `AudioContext` is created lazily on first user interaction.
- **Memory match is non-deterministic.** Card shuffle uses `Math.random()` on every load. The pairings are fixed (same item matches same word) but positions are randomized.
- **No backend.** Pure static site. No analytics, no user data collection, no cookies.
- **Mobile responsive.** The memory grid collapses from 5 columns to 4 columns below 480px viewport width. All animations are touch-compatible.
- **No external assets.** All illustrations are inline SVG. Only Google Fonts are fetched externally.
- **Deployment build time.** GitHub Pages takes ~30-60s to build after push. Verified via `GET /repos/.../pages` API returning `status: built`.

---

## 12. Open Questions / Future Work

- The `miniMax-M3` → `GLM-5.2 (z-ai)` model switch happened mid-session. Earlier references to "MiniMax" or "Nvidia Minimax 3" in this doc may be outdated; the orchestrator is currently `z-ai/glm-5.2` via Nous Portal.
- MoA could be re-attempted if OpenRouter credits are topped up — would have been useful for an alternative creative direction comparison.
- If Sev shares feedback post-reveal, consider adding a "replay" mode that lets her re-experience sections she liked.
- The disco groove is original (not the actual MJ track) to avoid copyright. If user wants the real song, a "Play Original" button linking to Spotify/YouTube could be added.

---

## 13. Credits
